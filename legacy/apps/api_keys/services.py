The secret part is what gets HMAC-hashed at rest. The lookup part is an
indexed plaintext column that makes verification O(1) without revealing
the secret. Verification then constant-time-compares the recomputed HMAC
against the stored hash.

A 30-second in-process revocation cache piggy-backs on Django's cache
framework so the next request after a revocation sees 401 quickly
without paying a DB round-trip on every authenticated call.
